# Opinion Mining For Product Reviews Using NLP

This project implements an automated system for analyzing product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system processes user-generated reviews from e-commerce platforms to extract meaningful insights about product performance and customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Automated gathering of product reviews from multiple e-commerce platforms
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, normalization, and preparation for analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced NLP algorithms to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Fake Review Detection**: Implementation of techniques to identify and filter out fake reviews
